# Contributing

When making a contribution to this repository via pull-request remember to follow the code of conduct, which is best summarized as:
* Be nice.
* Be respectful.
* Be thoughtful.
* Be open to feedback.

Even if your pull request does not get accepted do not fret!  
We still value every suggested code change and welcome developers of all skill levels to try their hand at altering our program, it's not about the destination, but rather the journey. 


## Handy tips to get your pull request accepted:

* **Start with small changes.**  Big overhauls to the program might not pan out, so it's good to at least get a feeling on what contributing is like before investing too much time into the project.
* **Have you tested the program with your change?**  Is there any bug/problem it creates?  If your pull request results in the application not functioning your pull request will likely not be accepted.
* **Give explanations as to what your pull request changes.**
